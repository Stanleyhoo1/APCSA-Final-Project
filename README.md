# APCSA-Final-Project

1. # Introduction
Period: 2
Group Members: Stanley Hoo
Group Name: Solar
Project Title: Space Simulator

2. # Description
Project Overview: This project will simulate our solar system. The user can make changes to it by changing the mass of planets, changing orbital paths, and the distance between planets. This will help us visualize how impactful some changes in our solar system can be over time. Everytime a change is made, the simulation will be reset with the new changes. 
# Functionalities
Planetary Orbits: Accurate depiction of planetary orbits around the sun based on gravitational forces.
Information Panels: Display details about each celestial body, including name, size, distance from the sun, and orbital period.
User Controls: Allow users to adjust the simulation speed, change the sizes of planets, and distance from the sun. Will either make this an input box or one of those drag bars.
Time Control: Enables users to speed up or slow down time to observe planetary movements in different time scales.
Libraries Needed
None
Additional Information
The simulation will scale down the vast distances and sizes in the solar system to fit within a manageable view, ensuring a balance between accuracy and usability.

4. # How Does It Work?
Running the Simulation
Setup: Download and open the Processing IDE. Load the provided code files into the IDE.
Execution: Run the main simulation file to start the program.
User Controls:
Viewing Information: Click on any planet to display its information panel with details about the celestial body.
Increasing Time: Increases the rate at which time is passing, in other words the simulation can be run faster or slower.
Adjusting Planet Properties: Users will be able to change the distance of planets to each other and the sun by dragging and dropping them. They can also increase the mass of a planet by using an input box or drag bar. Mass will be measured in units of Earths.
